## Metrics Measured

The following key performance indicators (KPIs) were measured before and after the optimization efforts:

| Metric                     | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement (%) |
|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Average Latency (ms)      | 150 ms              | 105 ms             | 30%              |
| Throughput (transactions/s) | 200                 | 250                | 25%              |
| CPU Utilization (%)        | 75%                 | 60%                | 20%              |
| Memory Usage (MB)         | 512                 | 400                | 22%              |
| Error Rate (%)             | 2%                  | 0.5%               | 75%              |

## Analysis of Results

The optimization efforts resulted in significant improvements across all measured metrics. Key observations include:

- **Latency Reduction**: The average latency decreased from 150 ms to 105 ms, enhancing the user experience and making the system more responsive.
- **Increased Throughput**: The system's ability to handle transactions improved by 25%, allowing for more orders to be processed during peak trading hours.
- **Resource Efficiency**: CPU and memory utilization decreased, indicating that the system is now operating more efficiently and can handle additional load without requiring more resources.
- **Error Rate Improvement**: The reduction in the error rate demonstrates increased stability and reliability of the trading system.

## Conclusion

The optimization efforts have successfully enhanced the performance of the trading system, achieving the desired objectives of reduced latency, increased throughput, and improved resource utilization. Continuous monitoring and further optimizations will be essential to maintain and improve performance as the system scales.
